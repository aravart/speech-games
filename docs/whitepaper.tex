\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is the goal of the project? What problem does it solve?}

\subsection{Who is meant to benefit?}

\subsection{What are the results or outcome of the project?}


\section{HCI Principles}

\subsection{What HCI principles were kept in mind in the design of our system?}

\subsection{How did those HCI principles influence our design decisions?}


\section{Blockly}

\subsection{What is the Blockly environment?}

\subsection{What is the goal of the Blockly project?}

\subsection{How are blocks arranged horizontally? What language do we use to describe this?}

\subsection{How are blocks arranged vertically? What language do we use to describe this?}

\subsection{Is just one chain of blocks allowed or several?}

\subsection{If several, how are they executed?}

\subsection{How does the user typically interact with Blockly?}

\subsubsection{What's the medium (hint: mouse)?}

\subsubsection{What actions are available?}

\subsubsection{How can we group them into categories?}

\subsubsection{How does moving blocks work?}

\subsubsection{How does deleting blocks work?}

\subsubsection{How does connecting blocks work?}

\subsubsection{How does separating blocks work?}


\section{Turtle}

\subsection{What is the turtle game?}

\subsection{What set of blocks are available to complete the game?}

\subsection{What do these blocks do?}

\subsection{Why is the game divided into levels?}

\subsection{How do the levels serve to teach different programming concepts?}


\section{Speech}

\subsection{Why did we decide to model speech using a}

\subsection{What choices did we make as we designed that grammar?}

\subsection{What commands are available in that grammar?}

\subsection{How do the user interface commands described earlier map to the commands in the grammar?  }


\section{Speech recognition}

\subsection{How do we perform the speech recognition? What do we use?}

\subsection{What tradeoffs are there in our decision by comparison to alternatives? What was gained and what lost?}


\section{Suggestions}

\subsection{Why do we give suggestions to the user? What HCI principle is behind this?}

\subsection{What is basis on which a speech suggestion is made? What circumstances trigger it?}

\subsection{What are the limitations of the current method and what future work might improve upon it?}

\subsection{Show an example of the suggestions box and workspace before and after an operation}


\section{Corrections}

\subsection{Give an example of a common recognition error that falls out of the grammar}

\subsection{What algorithm was used to correct recognition?}

\subsection{If there are any parameters to be fit in this correction algorithm, how were they fit?}

\subsubsection{What statistical procedure was use?}

\subsubsection{What data was gathered?}

\subsubsection{What assumptions were made that could be considered weaknesses of the model?}

\subsection{Give an example of a common case that the corrections algorithm, as currently implemented, fails on}


\section{Layout}

\subsection{How are commands intereted visually?}

\subsection{Where do new blocks go?}

\subsection{How are blocks reordered when one is moved?}

\subsection{What happens if the user runs out of space on the workspace?}

\subsection{Describe the layout algorithm in pseudocode}

\subsection{Show an example of the a before and after with the layout algorithm}

\subsection{Are there any cases that currently give problems for the layout algorithm?}


\section{Related Work}
