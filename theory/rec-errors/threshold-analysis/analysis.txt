Edit Threshold Analysis

Aim:
Try to find an optimal value for threshold that gives the best combined accuracy
on positive and negative examples.

Method:
1. Separated the examples which had valid utterances (marked positive/correct)
   and the invalid utterances (marked negative/incorrect).
2. Use Javascript to collect data about the accuracy corresponding to each
   threshold - run the analysis code (edit_threshold_analysis.js) on the 2 data
   files:-
   a. correct-utterances.csv
   b. incorrect-utterances.csv
   For the correct examples, get the accuracy by counting the total number of
   correct corrections (the utterance HAS to be corrected always in this case)
   For the incorrect examples, get the accuracy by counting the total number of
   times corrections were NOT made - since corrections are always valid, mapping
   an incorrect utterance to a valid command IS NOT CORRECT.
   Data is collected in the form of tuples - (threshold_value, accuracy)
3. This data is collected in (in)correct_utterances_threshold.csv file.
4. The data is now read by graph.py to plot the graphs using methods in util.py

Results:
1. The current optimal threshold, given that we weight each sample equally is
   0.22 and it gives 86% accuracy overall.
2. The optimal threshold if we weigh each category (positive and negative)
   equally without considering number of instances is 0.37 and it gives
   83% accuracy overall.

These results are great but they don't EXACTLY represent the true picture, here
is why:-
1. We have ~110 positive examples, and ~200 negative, this is not a true
   representation of our data. We would expect more positive examples.
2. The negative examples we have are mostly unrelated to anything in Blockly.
   Hence, we need examples that are incorrect but are still pretty close to
   being correct.
3. Sample size is still pretty low.
